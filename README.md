##README
####TO DO _(For Beta Version)_
- Implement a robust way to send questions from server to all clients in a reasonable amount of time and to get answers form all clients to the server as soon as possible
- Let clients connect to server without previously knowing the mac address
- Resolve the problem of question highlighted/question sent to clients (sending function uses the index of the database)
- add the possibility of using pictures when adding a new question
- Implement a way for the server program to display the results for each class (e.g. as a table). He should be able to get the results for students vs questions and some basic statistics (percentage of right answers)
